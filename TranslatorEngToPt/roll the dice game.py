Travel around the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.
*roll the die for player (generate a random number between 1-6 and advance that user that number of spaces on the game board.)
*after each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win
* repeat this 4 aditional times for 5 rolls in total.
*if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - they've won
